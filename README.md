# Minecraft Fabric Mods Changer

This program switches Minecraft mods between different versions.

It automatically detects the Minecraft version that the mods currently in the mods folder are compatible with, based on the name of the Fabric API JAR file. Therefore, it's important to have the correct Fabric API JAR file in your folder. (Note: This program only works for Fabric mods.)

All current mods will be saved to a folder inside your .minecraft\ directory, and you will be prompted to choose a Minecraft version for which to load mods into the mods folder.

Please note that while this program allows you to switch between versions, you will still need to install new mods manually by dragging them into the mods folder.
### While you can build this yourself if you want, there is a runnable EXE file inside the out/artifacts folder.
